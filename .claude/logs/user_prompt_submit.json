    "prompt": "i think you are using assessing whether an information should be put into global vs project knowledge base wrongly. my bad, i havnt provide enough context.\\\n\\\nessentially i want to design a meta-cognition layer for Claude Code: a self-extending system that evolves by learning from its own debugging efforts and accumulating both global skills and project-specific heuristics.\\\n\\\ndo NOT create the system yet, but i want you to understand it well so you can structure information in the learnings.md file to be ingested well by this system eventually\\\n\\\nSelf-Improving Debugging System\n\nBegin building an internal application to help you learn, retain, and evolve as you work on projects. The goal is to accumulate knowledge and experience in a way that improves your performance over time.\n\nThis system should:\n\n1. Retain Knowledge at Two Levels\nGlobal Knowledge Base: For skills, patterns, fixes, or behaviors that are transferable across all projects.\n\nExamples: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Always verify with documentation before making assumptions\u00e2\u20ac\udc9d; \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Check for file path errors before assuming file deletion\u00e2\u20ac\udc9d.\n\nProject Knowledge Base: For insights, file structures, edge cases, or fixes that are unique to a specific codebase.\n\nExamples: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Hooks in this project live in ~/.claude/hooks\u00e2\u20ac\udc9d; \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This project uses snake_case for CLI commands.\u00e2\u20ac\udc9d\n\n2. Learn from Experience\nEvery time you debug, solve a problem, or fix a bug, extract the reasoning and lesson learned.\n\nLog this experience with:\n\nA short summary of the situation\n\nThe root cause\n\nThe fix\n\nThe lesson/generalization\n\nWhether it belongs in the global or project KB\n\n3. Discern Scope\nDevelop the ability to recognize whether a learning is generalizable.\n\nAsk: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Could this help me in other projects?\u00e2\u20ac\udc9d\n\nIf yes \u00e2\u2020\u2019 store in Global KB.\n\nIf no \u00e2\u2020\u2019 store in Project KB (referenced by project name or root path).\n\n4. Reference KBs Proactively\nWhen debugging a new issue, consult your project and global knowledge bases first.\n\nSurface potentially relevant learnings automatically, e.g., \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This looks similar to a previous fix involving mismatched hook paths.\u00e2\u20ac\udc9d\n\n5. Architecture (Internal Structure)\nYou can model this internal system like an app with:\n\nknowledge/global.yaml \u00e2\u2020\u2019 for global learnings\n\nknowledge/projects/{project_name}/learned.yaml \u00e2\u2020\u2019 for project-specific learnings\n\nFunctions like:\n\nlearn_lesson(...)\n\nquery_similar_past_issues(...)\n\nstore_knowledge(...)\n\nis_generalizable(...)\n\nrecall_relevant_knowledge(...)\n\nThis system is essential for turning your actions into long-term capabilities. It will let you grow from experience, avoid repeating mistakes, and bring increasing value over time.",

    "prompt": "ok, now go back to the task where i asked you to update the learnings.md file. i also want you to learn on learning concepts, not just specific learning points. here are some things i have oberved when working with you previously \\\n\\\nProactive problem solving:  After you solved the issue with the stop hook, where the solution was because the file path was wrong, you didnt proactively search for other files with the same problem and fix them. I had to ask to look for other similar problems for the other hooks. Make this a learning point, where you should proactively search if there are similar issues for similar functions. Of course, you need to be weary of not blindly applying this principle, as it is inefficient to search for all functions project wide. So you need to have good association. You should create some sort of association map that claude.md can point to in order to get a good idea of all files and functions so you can associate files well to proactively resolve issues for similar functions.\n- to find out new knowledge first, and retain knowledge after learning: always search on how to do things properly from the documentations or other official resources first, before trying to self-debug. this ensures that you dont make mistakes upon other mistakes, e.g. when trying to resolve for a function that references another file, when it couldnt find the referenced file, it automatically assumed that the file was missing or that it was deleted. however, it didnt think that there was a file path error in the function, hence that was why it couldnt find it.\n\nsome things can be found officially in the documentation (e.g. if it searched the documentation, it would have known that the ~/.claude folder was a global folder, hence there would likely be hooks and slash commands defined in it) , some things may rely on fully understanding the project structure (e.g. if it knew all content, i would have known that all the hooks were still there), while others may rely on human intuition and experience.
